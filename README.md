# 360 Gaussian Splatting

This repository contains programs for reconstructing space using OpenSfM and Gaussian Splatting. For original repositories of OpenSfM and Gaussian Splatting, please refer to the links provided.

This is just my personal project.
If you've enjoyed using this project and found it helpful, 
I'd be incredibly grateful if you could chip in a few bucks to help cover the costs of running the GPU server.

## Environment Setup

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/inuex35/360-gaussian-splatting
```

### Creating the Environment

In addition to the original repository, install the following module as well:

```bash
pip3 install submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization submodules/simple-knn plyfile pyproj
```

## Training 360 Gaussian Splatting

First, generate point clouds using images from a 360-degree camera with OpenSfM. Refer to the following repository and use this command for reconstruction:
Visit https://github.com/inuex35/ind-bermuda-opensfm and opensfm documentation for more detail.

```bash
bin/opensfm_run_all your_data
```

Make sure the camera model is set to spherical. It is possible to use both spherical and perspective camera models simultaneously.

After reconstruction, a `reconstruction.json` file will be generated. You can use opensfm viewer for visualization.

Assuming you are creating directories within `data`, place them as follows:
```
data/your_data/images/*jpg
data/your_data/reconstruction.json
```

Then, start the training with the following command:

```bash
python3 train.py -s data/your_data --panorama
```

After training, results will be saved in the `output` directory. For training parameters and more details, refer to the Gaussian Splatting repository.

## Training parameter


Parameters for 360 Gaussian Splatting are provided with default values in 360-gaussian-splatting/arguments/__init__.py.

According to the original repository, it might be beneficial to adjust position_lr_init, position_lr_final, and scaling_lr.

Reducing densify_grad_threshold can increase the number of splats, but it will also increase VRAM usage.

densify_from_iter and densify_until_iter are also related to densification.

## TODO
Train with perspective and equirectangular images together.
Fish eye camera model.
